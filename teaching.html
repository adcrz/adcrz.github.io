            <h2>University of British Columbia</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Topics in the History of Mathematics (Math 446):</strong> This is a course about the development of mathematics that led up to what we know as calculus.</li>
                <li><strong>Introduction to Mathematics (Math 335):</strong> This course is mainly for teaching students who will be teaching mathematics at the primary school level. The focus here is mostly on math education.</li>
                <li><strong>Multivariable Calculus (Math 253):</strong> This is a standard course for STEM students starting with vectors and building towards Greens theorem.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Calculus II (Math 227):</strong> This is the honours multivariable calculus and is a more proof based course intended for students majoring in pure mathematics.</li>
                <li><strong>Mathematical Proof (Math 220):</strong> Standard introductory proof course.</li>
                <li><strong>Differential Calculus (Math 110):</strong> This is a year long differential calculus course. I ran some workshops that emphasizes getting the students to work in groups. </li>

            <h2>San Francisco State University</h2>
            <p>Here is a collection of the courses where I was the main instructor.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prelude to Calculus (Math 199):</strong> This is a semester long standard precalculus course. The content involves basics of algebra, functions and trigonometry.</li>
                <li><strong>Prelude to Calculus II (Math 198):</strong> This is the second half a year long precalculus course that focuses heavily on group work to facilitate learning.</li>
                <li><strong>Prelude to Calculus I (Math 197):</strong> This is the first half of a year long precalculus course that focuses heavily on group work to facilitate learning.</li>
