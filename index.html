	<h1>About Me... </h1>
	<p>I am a PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia working with professor Malabika Pramanik. Previously I was at San Francisco State University where I completed a master's in mathematics and a bachelor's in applied mathematics. Overtime my interests have changed but currently fall under the umbrella terms of geometric measure theory/fractal geometry.</p>
	<p> I can best be contacted via email: angeldc(at)math(dot)ubc(dot)ca.</p>
